                        <h2><b>Horizon: Zero Dawn </b></h2>
                        <p>Horizon Zero Dawn is an action role-playing game developed by Guerrilla Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.
						The plot follows Aloy, a hunter in a world overrun by machines, who sets out to uncover her past. The player uses ranged weapons,
						a spear, and stealth to combat mechanical creatures and other enemy forces. A skill tree provides the player with new abilities
						and bonuses. The player can explore the open world to discover locations and take on side quests. It was released for the PlayStation 4 
						in 2017, and will be released for Microsoft Windows in mid-2020.</p>
						<p>Horizon Zero Dawn is Guerrilla Games' first intellectual property since Killzone in 2004 and its first role-playing game. Development
						began in 2011 after the completion of Killzone 3, with director Mathijs de Jonge considering it the riskiest idea pitched at the time.
						The game engine, Decima, was developed for Killzone Shadow Fall and altered for Horizon Zero Dawn. Being set in a post-apocalyptic setting,
						anthropologists were consulted to authenticate the world's decay over a millennium. The soundtrack was led by composer Joris de Man, 
						featuring contributions from The Flight.</p>
						<p>Horizon Zero Dawn was praised by critics for its open world, story, visuals, combat, characterisation, and the performance of voice 
						actress Ashly Burch; however, the dialogue, melee combat, and character models received some criticism. The game won numerous awards and
						sold over 10 million copies by February 2019, making it one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games. An expansion, The Frozen Wilds, was 
						released in November 2017.</p>
