                       <h2><b>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</b></h2>
                       <p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda
					   Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and was 
					   released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 11, 2011.</p>
					   <p>The game's main story revolves around the player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater,
					   a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in Skyrim,
					   the northernmost province of Tamriel. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by 
					   improving skills. The game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the
					   game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.</p>
					   <p>Skyrim was developed using the Creation Engine, rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a unique and more diverse
					   open world than Oblivion's Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less
					   interesting by comparison. The game was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly mentioning the character advancement
					   and setting, and is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time. Nonetheless it received some criticism, predominantly
					   for its melee combat and numerous technical issues present at launch. The game shipped over seven million copies to retailers within the
					   first week of its release, and over 30 million copies on all platforms as of November 2016, making it one of the best selling video games
					   in history.</p>
					   <p>Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released (Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn) which were repackaged into The Elder 
					   Scrolls V: Skyrim – Legendary Edition and released in June 2013. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Special Edition is a remastered version
					   of the game released for Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 in October 2016. It includes all three DLC expansions and a graphical upgrade,
					   along with additional features such as modding capabilities on consoles. Versions were released in November 2017 for the Nintendo Switch and
					   PlayStation VR, and a stand-alone virtual reality (VR) version for Windows was released in April 2018. These versions were based on the 
					   remastered release, but the Switch version's graphics upgrade was relative to its hardware capabilities, and it did not include the
					   modding features.</p>
