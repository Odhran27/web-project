                        <center><p> This website was created as part of a web development project in 2020, the idea behind this website is that it gives people
						a place to go and search for games that they might want to play based off of other games they've played and enjoyed in the same genre.
						Ofcourse this is just a very simplified version of this idea, the fully functioning website would have a search engine, genre or even
						age group list, and of course a much more expansive library.</p></center>
